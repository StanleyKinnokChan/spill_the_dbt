# Spill the dbt :tea:

A series of practical data transformation challenges with dbt, designed to help you get comfortable with dbt and its functionality.

These challenges generally follow the content for the [dbt Analytics Engineer Certification](https://www.getdbt.com/certifications/analytics-engineer-certification-exam), providing hands-on experience with concepts covered in the certification.

```
gh repo clone your-username/spill_the_dbt
```

**3. Set Up Your Environment**

- Install Python: Ensure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed on your machine that is compatible with dbt. Check [What version of Python can I use?](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/core/pip-install)
- Install Required Python Packages, includes dbt-core, you may wish to [run dbt another way](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/core/installation-overview). 
- Setup your computer for [working on dbt projects](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/how-we-set-up-our-computers-for-working-on-dbt-projects/243)

**Create a virtual environment**
```
python -m venv dbt-env
```

**Activate your virtual environment**
Windows:
```
dbt-env\Scripts\activate
```
Mac / Linux
```
source dbt-env/bin/activate
```
**Install the required packages**
``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Work Through the Challenge**

- Follow the step-by-step instructions provided in the challenge markdown file.
- Write your dbt models, tests, and code as instructed.
- Use Git to commit your changes to your forked repository.

**5. Optional: Share Your Solutions**

If you'd like to share your solutions on social:
- Use the hashtag **#SpillTheDBT** 
- Add an image of your code with [carbon.now.sh/](https://carbon.now.sh/)
