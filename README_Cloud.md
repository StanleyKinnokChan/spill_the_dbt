# Spill the dbt :tea:

A series of practical data transformation challenges with dbt, designed to help you get comfortable with dbt and its functionality.

These challenges generally follow the content for the [dbt Analytics Engineer Certification](https://www.getdbt.com/certifications/analytics-engineer-certification-exam), providing hands-on experience with concepts covered in the certification.

## Getting Started

**ðŸ“º [Installation walkthrough now available](https://youtu.be/rSI1VcSpXq0)**

To work with these challenges, please follow the steps below:


**1. Set up dbt cloud**
#### dbt Cloud

If you are using dbt Cloud, you can skip the installation and setup steps for dbt Core and instead use the Cloud IDE provided by dbt.

##### Sign Up for dbt Cloud
Create an account at [dbt Cloud Sign Up](https://www.getdbt.com/signup).

##### Create a New Project
After signing up, create a new project in dbt Cloud.

> **Note:** The layout of the dbt Cloud interface may change over time.

##### Set Up Your Snowflake Connection
Configure the connection to your Snowflake account:

- **Connection Name:** `Snowflake-dbt-course`  
- **Account:** `ad21223.eu-west-1`  
- **Database:** `DBT_COURSE`  
- **Warehouse:** `DATASCHOOL_WH`  
- **Role:** `DATASCHOOL`

##### Configure Development Credentials
Update your development credentials:

- Change your **schema name** so your modeled data is written to your own schema during development.
- **Test** the connection.
- **Save** the credentials.

##### Integrate with GitHub
Connect your dbt Cloud project to a GitHub repository:

- Log into your GitHub account.
- Create a new repository to be managed by dbt Cloud.
